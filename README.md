A profound Java application that teaches life lessons through interactive plant growth simulation. Watch as your virtual plant grows through meaningful stages, learning about balance, growth, and the consequences of excess.

## 🎯 Core Message

**"Balance is the key to sustainable growth"**

This simulator demonstrates that just as plants need measured care to thrive, our personal ambitions and goals require wisdom and moderation to flourish.

## 🌟 Features

- **📱 Interactive GUI** - Beautiful Swing interface with meaningful visuals
- **💻 Console Version** - Text-based interface for terminal users
- **🌱 7 Growth Stages** - Each teaching profound life lessons
- **⚖️ Balance Education** - Learn consequences of excess through overwatering
- **🔄 Reset Functionality** - Start fresh and apply lessons learned
- **🎨 Visual Feedback** - Color-coded stages and meaningful messages

## 📖 Life Lessons Taught

| Stage | Life Lesson |
|-------|-------------|
| **Seed** | Foundation: Plant strong roots before reaching for the sky |
| **Sprout** | Emergence: Break through limitations with consistent effort |
| **Young Plant** | Growth: Build strength through challenges and adaptation |
| **Flowering Plant** | Blossom: Share your beauty and wisdom with the world |
| **Wilting** | Warning: Excess drains your vital energy |
| **Dying** | Decline: Overindulgence leads to irreversible damage |
| **Dead** | Lesson: Balance is the key to sustainable growth |
